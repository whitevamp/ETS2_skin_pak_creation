"""
Handles the creation of binary .tobj (Texture Object) files for ETS2/ATS.

.tobj files are used by the game engine to reference texture files (usually .dds)
and define certain properties related to how textures are loaded and used.
The exact meaning of many bytes in the .tobj format is not officially documented
and has been determined through community reverse-engineering and tools like
Mods Studio 2.

    """
    Writes a binary .tobj file, which is a small metadata file pointing to a texture (DDS).

    The .tobj file format contains a header and the path to the texture.
    Different `save_mode` options alter specific bytes in the header, potentially
    affecting texture properties like mipmapping or filtering, though the exact
    effects are often empirical.

    Args:
        tobj_filepath (Path): The full path where the output .tobj file will be saved.
        texture_path_in_mod (str): The relative path to the texture file (e.g., .dds)
                                   as it will be structured within the mod archive.
                                   Example: "/vehicle/truck/upgrade/paintjob/my_truck/skin01/texture.dds"
        save_mode (str): A string key representing different byte configurations for the .tobj header.
                         Valid modes are "default", "mode1", "mode2", "mode3".
                         Defaults to "default".
